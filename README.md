## Project Requirements

### Content
This portfolio showcases several projects that I have worked on and allows me to continue adding projects, showing my professional journey. I have embedded a fully functioning contact form that allows visitors to provide me with feedback or discuss colalboration. I have also included links to my GitHub, LinkedIn, Discord Profile and Instagram. 
- [x] At least one profile picture
- [x] Biography (at least 100 words)
- [x] Functional Contact Form
- [x] "Projects" section
- [x] Links to external sites, e.g. GitHub and LinkedIn.

### Technical
I have separated my content into two responsive pages, the main index page and a contact page. I have built the pages using semantic HTML, CSS and splash of JavaScript. During the project development I have been working off a "WIP" branch and merging to main once I'm happy to publish changes.
- [x] At least 2 web pages.
