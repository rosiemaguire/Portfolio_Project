          <h1>Hi, I'm Rosie!</h1>
          <p>
            Good morrow! I studied a Bachelor of Education (Primary) at QUT. I
            began working casually in Child Care (OSHC) during the second half
            of my degree and stayed in the field for eight years. In November
            2020, I pivoted my career trajectory and began working with child
            care software. Since working in the field of technology, I have
            learned and used SQL (Particularly Microsoft SQL), engaged in a
            Python Course via Udemy, began a Web Development course, also via
            Udemy and I am currently lucky enough to be studying with She Codes
            Australia in their 2023 Brisbane Plus cohort.

            <h3>BlackJack game</h3>
            <p>
              Last year I completed a online Python course via Udemy. I worked
              on various projects throughout this course, however my favourite
              was the BlackJack Game I created. This project is run entirely
              through the command line. As I was working on this project, my
              friends helped test my debugging skills (such as when they found
              that they could bet negative values)!
              <br />
              Feel free to give this one a go yourself and let me know if you
              find any bugs or have any improvement suggestions!
              <br />
              You'll find the repo
              <a href="https://github.com/rosiemaguire/blackjack">here</a>.

            <h3>My First HTML Website</h3>
            <p>
              As I commenced an online Web Development Course, the first task
              was to create a HTML website. The initial product used tables, no
              CSS and looked like something you would see on the web in the
              1990s. I have since added a bit of CSS and JavaScript,
              predominantly to make a fun spinning image in the hobbies page.

            <h3>Group Project: MarioKart Leaderboard</h3>
            <p>
              Two of my colleagues and friends and I are currently collaborating
              and creating a digital leaderboard available to use for adding and
              viewing Mario Kart maps race times. The project is currently using
              HTML, CSS, HCL, Shell and JS.
              <br />While this is still a work in progress, if you'd like to
              follow along with this project, the repo is

            <h3>She Codes Portfolio Site</h3>
            <p>
              How could I talk about my projects without mentioning this one?
              This website was my very first project with She Codes Australia.
              It is my first time learning about and using semantic HTML,
              setting CSS variables and much more. I hope to continue updating
              this site over time as I learn new skills and look forward to
              comparing the end product with my very first website to see how
              far I have come and what I can achieve!
