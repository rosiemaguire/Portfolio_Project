                <h3>BlackJack game</h3>
                <p>
                  Last year I completed a online Python course via Udemy. I worked
                  on various projects throughout this course, however my favourite
                  was the BlackJack Game I created. This project is run entirely
                  through the command line. As I was working on this project, my
                  friends helped test my debugging skills (such as when they found
                  that they could bet negative values)!
                  <br />
                  Feel free to give this one a go yourself and let me know if you
                  find any bugs or have any improvement suggestions!
                  <br />

                <h3>My First HTML Website</h3>
                <p>
                  As I commenced an online Web Development Course, the first task
                  was to create a HTML website. The initial product used tables, no
                  CSS and looked like something you would see on the web in the
                  1990s. I have since added a bit of CSS and JavaScript,
                  predominantly to make a fun spinning image in the hobbies page.

                <h3>Group Project: MarioKart Leaderboard</h3>
                <p>
                  Two of my colleagues and friends and I are currently collaborating
                  to create a digital leaderboard available to use for adding and
                  viewing Mario Kart maps race times. The project is currently using
                  HTML, CSS, HCL, Shell and JS.
                  <br />While this is still a work in progress, if you'd like to
                  follow along with this project, the repo is

                <h3>She Codes Portfolio Site</h3>
                <p>
                  How could I talk about my projects without mentioning this one?
                  This website was my very first project with She Codes Australia.
                  It is my first time learning about and using semantic HTML,
                  setting CSS variables and much more. I hope to continue updating
                  this site over time as I learn new skills and look forward to
                  comparing the end product with my very first website to see how
                  far I have come and what I can achieve!
